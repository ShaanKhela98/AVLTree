# AVLTree

An AVL tree is a type of binary search tree. Named after it's inventors Adelson, Velskii, and Landis, AVL trees have the property of dynamic self-balancing in addition to all the other properties exhibited by binary search trees. A BST is a data structure composed of nodes.


How program works is that it reads in a text file and uses the commands along with a value to build 

Text file commands:
---------------------
BuildTree (weight value), (root value) - uses a weighted value to compare tree heights (left vs right) and rebalances with new root + leaf values
Insert (value)
Delete (value)
Search (value)
Print (Tree)
Done (exits program)


To run program, you must have Python3 installed.
  - Open terminal where main.py + tree.py are located
  - Type in terminal "python3 main.py"
  - Enjoy!
